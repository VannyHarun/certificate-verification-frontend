      question: "What is the Certificate Verification System?",
      answer: "The Certificate Verification System is a secure platform that allows educational institutions to issue digital certificates and enables employers, students, and other stakeholders to verify the authenticity of these certificates using a unique certificate hash."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I verify a certificate?",
      answer: "To verify a certificate, simply enter the certificate hash (provided on the certificate) in the verification form on our homepage. The system will display the certificate details if it's authentic."
    },
    {
      question: "What information is needed to verify a certificate?",
      answer: "You only need the certificate hash, which is a unique alphanumeric code provided on each certificate. This hash serves as a secure identifier for the certificate in our system."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is the verification process?",
      answer: "Our verification process uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the highest level of security. Each certificate is assigned a unique hash that cannot be tampered with, ensuring that only authentic certificates can be verified."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I verify multiple certificates at once?",
      answer: "Currently, our system only supports verifying one certificate at a time. However, we're working on a batch verification feature for future releases."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if a certificate cannot be verified?",
      answer: "If a certificate cannot be verified, it may be fraudulent or there might be an error in the hash you entered. Double-check the hash and try again. If it still fails, contact the issuing institution or our support team for assistance."
    },
    {
      question: "How can educational institutions join the system?",
      answer: "Educational institutions interested in using our system to issue secure digital certificates can contact our team through the Contact page. We'll provide information about integration options and pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a mobile app for certificate verification?",
      answer: "We don't currently offer a mobile app, but our website is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices. You can verify certificates from any smartphone or tablet with an internet connection."
